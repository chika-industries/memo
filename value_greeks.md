### **Memo: Value Greeks - A Conceptual Framework for Long-Term Investing**

#### 1.0 Purpose

This memo introduces the concept of "Value Greeks" - a parallel framework to the Black-Scholes options Greeks that reframes key investment sensitivities from liabilities into advantages for long-term value investors.

#### 2.0 Background

In options trading, the Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, Rho) represent sensitivities that traders must constantly manage as risks. This memo explores how these same forces can be transformed from enemies into allies through a value investing approach.

#### 3.0 Conceptual Framework: From Trading Greeks to Value Greeks

The table below maps traditional options Greeks to their value investing counterparts:

| **Value Greek** | **Options Greek** | **Value Investing Interpretation** | **Strategic Advantage** |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Compounding Theta (Θᵥ)** | Theta (time decay) | Value grows with time via reinvested earnings | Time becomes an ally - wealth compounds rather than decays |
| **Moat Delta (Δᵥ)** | Delta (price sensitivity) | Sensitivity to business fundamentals rather than price | Fundamental value is more stable than market price |
| **Resilience Gamma (Γᵥ)** | Gamma (delta sensitivity) | Ability to adapt to fundamental changes | Quality businesses navigate change without catastrophic value shifts |
| **Opportunity Vega (νᵥ)** | Vega (volatility sensitivity) | Market volatility expands opportunity set | Price dislocations create buying opportunities |
| **Margin-of-Safety Rho (ρᵥ)** | Rho (interest rate sensitivity) | Protection against macro-economic shifts | Margin of safety provides buffer against rate changes |

#### 4.0 Comparative Analysis

**4.1 Options Trader Perspective**
- Greeks represent constant risks requiring active management
- Time decay erodes value
- Volatility introduces uncertainty
- Requires continuous monitoring and adjustment

**4.2 Value Investor Perspective**
- Value Greeks represent structural advantages
- Time amplifies returns through compounding
- Volatility creates opportunity through mispricing
- Allows for patient, infrequent decision-making

#### 5.0 Strategic Implications

The Value Greeks framework highlights why value investing scales more efficiently than active trading:

- **Reduced cognitive load** - No need for constant position monitoring
- **Positive time value** - Investments improve with holding period
- **Volatility as opportunity** - Market fluctuations become beneficial
- **Fundamental anchoring** - Decisions based on business quality rather than price movements

#### 6.0 Conclusion

While options traders must constantly battle against their Greeks, value investors can harness these same forces through a different mindset and strategy. The Value Greeks framework demonstrates how time, volatility, and economic sensitivity can be transformed from liabilities into enduring advantages through disciplined fundamental investing and patience.

This conceptual mapping provides a useful mental model for understanding why value investing principles create sustainable edges in market participation.
