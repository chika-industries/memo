### **Memo: The Power of Strategic Inaction - Lessons from Li Lu's Q4 2024 13F Filing**

#### 1.0 Purpose

This memo analyzes the Q4 2024 13F filing from Himalaya Capital, managed by Li Lu, which reported zero portfolio activity. The purpose is to highlight the strategic discipline of inaction in long-term investing and its value as a counterpoint to market noise and the inherent human bias toward activity.

#### 2.0 Background

The quarterly release of 13F filings often triggers a wave of sensationalized financial media coverage, focusing predominantly on the buying and selling activities of prominent investors. This noise can create pressure for investors to act. However, the most significant action in a portfolio is sometimes the conscious decision to take *no action*.

#### 3.0 Case Study: Himalaya Capital's Q4 2024 Filing

Himalaya Capital's filing for the fourth quarter of 2024 reported no transactions: no new positions initiated, and no existing positions sold or added to.

This inactivity occurred against a backdrop of notable moves by other investors, including:
*   Warren Buffett trimming positions in Bank of America and Apple.
*   Other Berkshire Hathaway devotees, such as Chris Bloomstran, reducing their stakes.
*   Significant appreciation in holdings like East West Bancorp (EWBC), which had doubled in value, creating a typical temptation to "lock in profits."

#### 4.0 Analysis: Inaction as a Deliberate Strategy

Li Lu's inactivity should not be misinterpreted as passivity or neglect. It is the result of a disciplined, long-term philosophy centered on two core principles:

**4.1 Independent Conviction**
The decision to hold steady, despite actions by influential figures like Buffett, demonstrates deep, independent conviction in the underlying thesis of each holding. It reflects an investment process that is immune to the "noise" of quarterly headlines and peer activity.

**4.2 Commitment to Compounding**
The primary engine of long-term returns is the uninterrupted compounding of value in high-quality businesses. Li Lu's philosophy, heavily influenced by Charlie Munger, views unnecessary trading as a tax on this compounding process. The goal is not to out-trade others but to provide capital to exceptional companies and allow them to grow over decades.

#### 5.0 The Behavioral Challenge

Action is easy; disciplined inaction is profoundly difficult. Human psychology is wired to equate activity with progress and control. The temptation to react to price movements, news, or the actions of others is a constant challenge for investors. Li Lu's Q4 filing serves as a powerful reminder that resisting this temptation is a hallmark of a mature investment strategy.

#### 6.0 Conclusion and Implication

The most insightful lesson from Li Lu's recent filing is not found in a transaction, but in the absence of one. In a world that rewards visibility and activity, true investing strength often lies in the quiet confidence to hold steady.

For the individual investor, the key takeaway is to evaluate portfolio decisions based on long-term business fundamentals, not short-term market movements or the actions of others. As Charlie Munger advocated, the most effective strategy can often be to "sit on your ass(ets)" and let the mathematics of compounding work unimpeded. Strategic inaction, when rooted in rigorous analysis and conviction, is not a voidâ€”it is a deliberate and powerful investment action in itself.
