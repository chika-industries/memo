### **Memo: Defining Business Growth Through the Accounting Equation**

#### 1.0 Purpose

This memo provides a foundational explanation of what constitutes "growth" for a business, using the basic accounting equation as a framework. The goal is to demystify financial terminology and clarify how genuine growth translates into increased value for shareholders.

#### 2.0 Background

The term "growth" is frequently used in business reporting but often remains vaguely defined. For an investor, understanding growth requires moving beyond superficial metrics and examining the fundamental financial structure of a company, as represented by its balance sheet.

#### 3.0 The Core Framework: The Accounting Equation

The entire financial position of a company can be summarized by the accounting equation:

**Assets = Liabilities + Equity**

*   **Assets:** Resources owned by the company (e.g., cash, inventory, property).
*   **Liabilities:** Obligations or debts owed to outsiders.
*   **Equity:** The residual interest or net worth belonging to the shareholders.

This equation must always balance. Any change in one element necessitates a change in another.

#### 4.0 What Constitutes Real Growth?

For a shareholder, real growth is not merely an increase in the size of the company (total assets) but an increase in their claim on those assets. This is measured by the growth of **Shareholders' Equity**.

The equation for equity is derived as follows:
**Equity = Assets - Liabilities**

Therefore, growth in equity occurs when the value of assets increases more than the value of liabilities. A company can grow its assets by taking on more debt (increasing liabilities), but this only creates value for shareholders if the acquired assets generate returns that exceed the cost of that debt.

#### 5.0 The Mathematics of Proportional Growth

The principle of growth can be illustrated by applying a scaling factor to the accounting equation.

Starting point:
`Assets = Liabilities + Equity`

Multiplying both sides by a growth factor `a` (e.g., 1.1 for 10% growth):
`a * Assets = a * Liabilities + a * Equity`

This demonstrates that when a company grows proportionally—meaning its assets and liabilities scale together—shareholders' equity scales by the same factor. The key insight is that balanced growth across the balance sheet leads to a direct increase in the value of the ownership stake.

#### 6.0 Connecting Business Growth to Shareholder Value

The increase in equity represents the creation of shareholder value. Assuming the number of shares remains constant (no dilution), each share represents a claim on a larger pool of equity.

It is critical to distinguish this fundamental growth from short-term stock price fluctuations. While market prices are influenced by sentiment and news, the long-term trajectory of a stock's value is ultimately anchored to the growth of the company's underlying equity.

#### 7.0 Historical Context

The framework for this analysis stems from double-entry bookkeeping, a system formalized by the Italian mathematician Luca Pacioli in 1494. This discipline ensures every transaction is recorded in two accounts, maintaining the balance of the equation and providing a clear picture of financial health.

#### 8.0 Conclusion

"Growth" in a business context is a precise concept: it is the increase in shareholders' equity resulting from a balanced expansion of the balance sheet. For investors, focusing on the sustainable growth of equity, rather than temporary asset inflation or stock price movements, is essential for long-term success. Understanding this principle allows one to look past headlines and assess the genuine financial progress of a company.
